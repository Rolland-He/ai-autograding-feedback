Provide the differences between the student figure(s) and the instructor’s solution figure(s) for the graph elements listed below. Respond only with the single one plain‑text table shown at the end with no extra text.

CONTEXT

Student figure: {submission_image}
Solution figure: {solution_image}

Follow these steps:

Inspect each aspect below in the student figure and its counterpart in the solution; note any problems or mismatches.
a. Main Title
b. Subplot Titles (if any)
c. Axis Labels and Units
d. Scale Numbers / Ticks (legibility, spacing, formatting)
e. Graph Type
f. Caption or Figure Note
g. Data Points
h. Accuracy vs Solution (data values, encodings, ordering)
i. Other

For every problem record, populate these table columns:
• Student — brief description of the element as it appears in the student figure
• Solution — corresponding description from the instructor’s figure
• Issue & Why — concise statement of the mismatch that includes readability, accuracy, or style. Be detailed in statistics.
• Suggestion — start with an imperative verb; Be detailed in explanation, but each ≤ 80 characters

Information efficiency: if a different chart type or layout would convey the data more clearly, include that comment in the Issue & Why cell of the “Graph Type / Color & Legend” row.

If there are additional missing fields or concerns not covered above, record them in the Other row. If none, write “N/A” across that row.

Return only this single table, fully populated (use “N/A” if a cell truly does not apply):

| Feature | Student | Solution | Issue & Why | Suggestion |
| Main Title | | | | |
| Subplot Titles | | | | |
| Axis Labels & Units | | | | |
| Scale Numbers / Ticks | | | | |
| Graph Type | | | | |
| Caption / Note | | | | |
| Data Points | | | | |
| Accuracy vs Solution | | | | |
| Other | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
